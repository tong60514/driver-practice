Vigith's Beer Bottle License 
----------------------------

If you like this code (don't have to be useful though), next time when you meet me,
you can get me a beer (and for those who don't drink, get me a donut).

This code is your code, do whatever you want to do with it, BUT if things go bad because
of this code I will shamelessly refute the authorship of this code :-).


SERIOUSLY!, I am not a proper kernel hacker, just a random guy who likes poking "the kernel".
This code is not efficient and is not guaranteed to work in a concurrent system (it worked for
me somehow :-). Patches are welcome!
