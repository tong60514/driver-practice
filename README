Purpose
-------
To help understand which is the most commonly 'pressed' and 'released' key in 
the keyboard. Holding a key down will generate 'pressed' events more so, count
of pressing need not be equal to release count. (This code works only for ps/2 
keyboards, not usb which generates interrupt in different IRQ line.)

How To Use
----------
Please don't proceed if you see any error in the below steps.

0. 0rth Law (as in thermodynamics)
cat LICENSE

1. compile 
a. create the header files
$ make header

(
sometimes the above may not work, as it won't be able to get 
file descriptor. please run as sudo 
$ sudo make header
)

b. compile the source
$ make

2. Insert the module into kernel and setup the system
$ keyboard_stats_load

3. Read the statistics
$ cat /dev/keyboard_stats

4. Remove the module and system
$ keyboard_stats_unload

5. Cleaning the dir
$ make clean

DEBUGGING
---------
Mail the author or read /var/log/messages and try your luck 
by setting the scancodes etc.

Misc
----
I wrote this code because few of my keys are more shiny than others
and i had to find out why!! :-)

Bugs
----
In my MAC VM, some keys were not working, like arrow keys!
